<br />

I have 2 year of entry experience as a SOC analyst. I have a strong understanding and experience with incident handling, log analysis and threat hunting. I have been involved in a full incident management lifecycle. My main domain is blue teaming, especially SIEM, but I am also familiar with penetration testing and have a basic experience as a manual QA.
